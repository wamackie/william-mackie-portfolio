The website required numerous changes. There were several semantic labeling issues. div class="header" and div class="footer" were changed to simply header and footer. There were overlapping/unneccesary div classes, causing some div classes to be relabeled into simply div ids. An unworking link was fixed as to create full site functionality. Images were given alt tags to ensure proper functioning within search engines and accessability tech. Footer text was resized in order to given proper sizing to the element.
  
  In CSS, code was split into appropriate groupings to give better readability. Reorganization was required in order to group like items together. Some periods were removed while some # were added to ensure functionality following HTML div class/div id name changes.
